# Exercise 3: Merge Conflicts

## Goal
Learn how to identify and resolve merge conflicts.

## Tasks
1. Checkout to `main` and edit the last line of `sample-code/index.html` to add: `<!-- Edited on main -->`
2. Commit the change.
3. Checkout to a new branch `conflict-test`, edit the same line but with a different comment: `<!-- Edited on conflict-test -->`
4. Commit and try to merge `conflict-test` into `main`.
5. Resolve the merge conflict manually.
6. Commit the resolved changes.
